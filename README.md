# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a dataset related to **gaming habits and their impact on academic/work performance**.

The goal is to:
- understand the structure of the data,
- distinguish between **quantitative** and **qualitative** variables,
- visualize distributions, outliers, and relationships between features.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains **1000 observations** and **14 features**.

### 🔢 Quantitative (Numerical) Features
These represent measurable quantities:
- Age
- Daily_Gaming_Hours
- Weekly_Gaming_Hours
- Sleep_Hours
- Stress_Level
- Focus_Level
- Academic_or_Work_Score
- Productivity_Level

### 🏷 Qualitative (Categorical) Features
These represent categories or labels:
- User_ID
- Gender
- Occupation
- Game_Type
- Primary_Gaming_Time
- Performance_Impact

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Inspection
- Checked data types and missing values
- Verified dataset size and structure

### 2️⃣ Visualization Techniques

#### 📈 Histogram
Used to analyze the distribution of numerical features.

#### 📦 Boxplot
Used to visualize quartiles (Q1, median, Q3) and detect outliers.

#### 🔵 Scatter Plot
Used to explore relationships between two numerical variables
(e.g. Weekly_Gaming_Hours vs Academic_or_Work_Score).

---

## 🧠 Key Observations
- Several numerical features contain outliers.
- Relationships between gaming activity and performance can be observed.
- Categorical variables were identified for further encoding if needed.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This EDA provides a solid understanding of the dataset and prepares it
for further steps such as feature engineering and machine learning.
